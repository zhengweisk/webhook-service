# rancher-auth-service
A REST Service listening on port 8090 that implements authentication Identity providers to support the Rancher Auth Framework. Initial version comes with github support. It uses the pluggable provider model to implement other providers later. 


APIs exposed are:

POST /v1-rancher-auth/config
This will save the provided config to the Cattle Database as settings and initialize the auth provider with the given config

GET /v1-rancher-auth/config

POST /v1-rancher-auth/reload
This will read the auth config from settings table in Cattle Database and re-initialize the auth provider

POST /v1-rancher-auth/token  
This API authenticates with the actual auth provider(like github) and returns a JWT token to be used for further communication with the service

This API lists the user details and his/her group memberships, for the user identified by the token set in Authorization header
